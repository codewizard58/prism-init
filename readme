I have finally got feed-up and have decided to release what I have done
so far. The main directories you need are

        PRISM   Source in C.
        UNIX    builds PRISM for UNIXes.
        DOS     builds PRISM for MSDOS.

To build a version for your machine, you should make a directory and then 
copy the unix or dos directories into it. The PRISM directory has the source
file in it and the makefiles in the unix or dos directories copy the 
required files before compiling them.

I have done this so that from the one source directory I can build a unix
and a dos and an Atari ST version. My favorite editor is WordStar 4 when
I am program editing so the source files are stripped of the extra 
characters by the makefile when they are copied from the PRISM to the make
directory. You should only do editing in the PRISM dir.

Other directories may be

        DB      Some Databases
        EXE     DOS executables
        TAR     a DOS .tar file read/writer.
